InitialDataCleaning.ipynb includes the source code for performing all the data cleaning from csv files created after saving all xls files as csv. There are all explanations needed to understand what was done.

linkedin_all.csv includes all of the data in one place, with dates in a suitable format and the degrees standardised to Bachelor, Master, Doctorate, Other (this is not perfect but works reasonably well).

linkedin_rim_waterloo.csv includes only people who worked for RIM in Waterloo. There are columns for if they left RIM after 2008 or before (or still employed at RIM), and also their subsequent jobs after leaving RIM. About 1/5 of all observations from linkedin_all.csv are there (over 1100 people are in linkedin_rim_waterloo.csv).
